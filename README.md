Q: What is this?

A: It is a file encrypter. Little project of mine that got me into programming. Most of it is beginner code so its not the greatest, and this was made before I knew what PEP8 was about. Dunno why I named it Revenant, but it stuck. Went through several rewrites, and this is the end result. It works on Linux only, and tested only on Debian distributions.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Place this directory on the first level of your /home/ folder, and run the command "python3 Revenant_install.py" and let it run. You may need to give your sudo password in order to install the graphical library (PySimpleGUI.) After that, enter requirements on the GUI, and you have install Revenant. The source code for the project is in the folder, and the installer works with any modifications to the source code file. DO NOT RENAME THE FOLDER THIS IS IN, AS THAT WILL BREAK THE INSTALLER.
